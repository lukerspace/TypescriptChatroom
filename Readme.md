# 💬 Chat Application

This is a lightweight real-time chat application built with Node.js and Express. It demonstrates a full-stack web development workflow using vanilla JavaScript on the front end and socket-based messaging on the back end. The project is designed as a personal learning initiative to explore the fundamentals of web sockets, real-time communication, and full-stack integration.

## 🧠 Motivation

This project was developed as part of my portfolio to showcase my ability to:

- Build and structure a full-stack application from scratch
- Implement real-time communication via WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- Work with server-client architecture and RESTful routing
- Apply best practices in backend development with Express

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time multi-user chat
- Clean and responsive front-end UI
- Room-based conversation architecture (extendable)
- Simple nickname support (can be extended with login)
- Modular routing for scalability
